Astolfo Discord Bot Repository


# IMPORTANT : main.js and the other updated Atolfo coding files as folders are the only file needed to be here in the Main branch

# Astolfo coding files That are still in working should be in the "Working" branch in Issues

# Known Bugs that are in fixing process should be in the Known Bugs" branch in Issues as the Astolfo coding files with that bug not yet fixed.

# When Known Bugs are fixed, the Astolfo coding files where the bug was in, need to be updated in the Main Branch
